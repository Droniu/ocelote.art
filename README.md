## ocelote.art

This is the source code for my personal photography website, [ocelote.art](https://ocelote.art). It's a SSG Next.js app written in Typescript and uses Tailwind CSS for styling.

Strapi CMS is used as backend for galleries and images. The backend is hosted on AWS EC2, and the frontend is hosted on Netlify.

### Development

For animations I wanted to avoid Framer Motion because of large bundle size so instead I've used some cool libraries I found:
- [animzyx](https://animxyz.com/)
- [react-tilt-parallax](https://github.com/mkosir/react-parallax-tilt)

I have also used some components from:
- [tailwind-kit](https://www.tailwind-kit.com/components)
- [Tailwind-Elements](https://tailwind-elements.com/)
